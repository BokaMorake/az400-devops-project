# Reflection – AZ-400 Practical Assessment  
### Bag Boutique DevOps Project

---

## 1. What I Learned  
During this project, I learned how to apply DevOps principles to a real-world system.  
I gained hands-on experience with:

- Setting up GitHub repositories and managing code versions  
- Working with Git commands (commit, push, pull, merge, fix conflicts)  
- Creating automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions  
- Deploying a static frontend website using GitHub Pages  
- Deploying a backend Node.js API using Render  
- Creating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using JSON  
- Monitoring workflows, builds, and issues  
- Using Excel to create dashboards  
- Writing documentation for DevOps processes  

This assessment helped me understand how all DevOps tools and practices connect to support continuous integration and continuous delivery.

## 2. Challenges I Faced  
During the assessment, I encountered several challenges:

- Errors when pushing and pulling Git changes  
- Merge conflicts and unrelated histories  
- GitHub Actions workflow failures  
- Render backend crashes due to incorrect server configuration  
- CSV import issues in Excel (text vs number formats)  
- Table name issues when building PivotTables  
- Understanding structured references in Excel formulas  
- YAML workflow indentation mistakes  
- Hidden mistakes caused by folder structure issues  

Although these challenges slowed me down, I solved each one and gained confidence in troubleshooting DevOps problems.

## 3. How I Solved These Challenges  
I improved my problem-solving skills by:

- Reading error messages carefully  
- Making small fixes and retesting step-by-step  
- Using Git Bash to check my repo status  
- Correcting YAML spacing errors  
- Fixing backend server code to support Render's dynamic port  
- Re-importing CSV data properly into Excel  
- Renaming and restructuring files inside VS Code  
- Refreshing PivotTables after data fixes  
- Asking for clarification and checking documentation  

These solutions taught me how important debugging and attention to detail are in DevOps.

## 4. Key DevOps Skills I Improved  
This project helped me strengthen the following skills:

- **Automation**: building workflows that run automatically  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: defining infrastructure settings in JSON  
- **Monitoring**: tracking builds, issues, and performance  
- **Continuous Improvement**: modifying pipelines based on failures  
- **Deployment**: managing multiple hosting platforms  
- **Version Control**: working with Git branching, merging, and commits  
- **Documentation**: writing technical documents clearly  
- **Problem-solving**: resolving real deployment and configuration issues

## 5. Overall Reflection  
This project gave me a deeper understanding of DevOps as a discipline.  
I learned that DevOps is not just tools — it is:

- Collaboration  
- Automation  
- Monitoring  
- Continuous delivery  
- Constant improvement  

Completing this assessment boosted my confidence and prepared me for working with real DevOps pipelines in the future.

## 6. Conclusion  
The assessment helped me apply DevOps practices in a practical scenario.  
I now feel more skilled in CI/CD, Git, deployments, monitoring, and writing Infrastructure as Code.  
The project was challenging but very rewarding, and it strengthened my abilities in cloud and DevOps engineering.
